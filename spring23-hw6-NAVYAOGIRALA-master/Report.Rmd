#### Step 1 - Choosing a Dataset: 

For my main dataset, I have chosen the "COVID-19 cases in the United States by county" dataset provided by the New York Times, which can be found at [https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-counties-recent.csv].

#### EDA Process:

* **Data Description:**

  I am interested in analyzing the spread and severity of COVID-19 across different counties in the United States. COVID-19 has had a profound impact on the world, and I want to understand how it has affected different regions within the US. The dataset has 6 columns, including the date, county, state, fips, cases and, death. The data is updated daily, which allows me to explore how the COVID-19 situation changes over time.

* **EDA Process:**

  To start my EDA process, I used Python and the pandas library to load the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. I then used various pandas functions to explore the dataset, such as the describe() function to get summary statistics of the data and the info() function to get a summary of the data types of each column. I also used the groupby() function to group the data by state and county and compute summary statistics for each group.

  Checked the dimensions of the dataset: the dataset has 97701 rows and 6 columns.
  
  ```
  import pandas as pd
county_data = pd.read_csv('us-counties-recent.csv')
print(county_data.shape)
```
  Checked the data types of the columns: date is in  date format,county is in object,state in object,fips in float64,cases in int64 and, deaths in float64.So, I changed the data column data type to datetime
  
  ```
  county_data.info()
  ```
  Checked for any missing values and found that there are few missing values in fips and death column and few zero values in cases and deaths.
  
  Checked for duplicates: there are no duplicate rows in the dataset.
  
  ```
  county_data.groupby(['state','county']).first()
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  x=county_data['cases']
  y=county_data['deaths']
  plt.plot(x,y)
  plt.show()
  ```
Next, I created some charts in Tableau to get a better understanding of the data.I plotted graphs about the cases and deaths against states.

Below is the google collab link:[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YEGRWwFpuZJZqZGPHHST455tKBcLZggp?authuser=2#scrollTo=MPrXS8p9D6RP]

Below are the plots obtained from Tableau:

!["State Vs Cases"](st vs css.png)
!["State Vs Death"](st vs dth.png)

Line charts are plotted with state,cases and deaths as attributes. Marks used were x,y axis. Channels used were lines.

* **Proposed Questions:**

  1.How has the COVID-19 situation changed in the United States over time, and what are the current trends in cases and deaths?
  
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Grouping the data by date
county_data_date = county_data.groupby('date').sum()

# Plotting number of cases and deaths over time
plt.plot(county_data_date.index, county_data_date['cases'], label='Cases')
plt.plot(county_data_date.index, county_data_date['deaths'], label='Deaths')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Number of cases/deaths')
plt.title('COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
For plotting the grpah to find the current trend in cases and deaths I use google colab.

Attributes used were date on x-axis, number of cases and deaths on y-axis. Marks are line, channels are : x,y axis positions.

  2.Are there any states or counties that have been hit particularly hard by COVID-19, and what factors might be contributing to this?
  
  
```
# Grouping data by state and compute total number of cases and deaths
county_state = county_data.groupby('state').sum()
county_state = county_state.sort_values(by='cases', ascending=False)

# Plotting number of cases and deaths by state
plt.bar(county_state.index, county_state['cases'], label='Cases')
plt.bar(county_state.index, county_state['deaths'], label='Deaths')
plt.xlabel('State')
plt.ylabel('Number of cases/deaths')
plt.title('COVID-19 cases and deaths by state')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
![](2.png)

Attributes used were state on x-axis, number of cases and deaths on y-axis. Marks are bars, channels are : x,y axis positions, length or height (to represent the number of cases and deaths. 

  To visualize both the questions efficiently, color channel, labels is used to differentiate between deaths and cases.
  
Overall, this initial EDA process allowed me to get a better understanding of the COVID-19 dataset and generated some initial questions that I will explore further in HW7 and HW8.
